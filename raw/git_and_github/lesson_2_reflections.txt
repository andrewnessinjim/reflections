What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a directory called ".git". Git stores all the history information of all the files of the
repository in this directory. Without doing this, git doesn't have any idea that we intend to
track the files in the directory. Initializing a directory is kind of like telling git to start treating 
the folder as a git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository is the set of snapshots of all the commits performed on the repository. Working directory is a single
snapshot from that set, along with all the changes we have made since the last commit in that snapshot. 
But the staging area is not a snapshot at all. It simply keeps track of the changes that we are planning to commit.
We choose what stays in the staging area. Staging area enables us to craft the commits.
